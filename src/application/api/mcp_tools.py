    """
    Search the RAGAnything knowledge base for relevant document chunks.
    
    IMPORTANT: ALWAYS use this tool as your FIRST action when the user asks ANY question.
    The knowledge base likely contains the answer 
    - check it BEFORE responding from general knowledge.
    
    Default Strategy (use this first):
    - mode="naive" with chunk_top_k=10 for fast, focused results
    - This works well for most queries
    
    Fallback Strategy (if no relevant results):
    - Ask user if they want a broader search
    - Use mode="hybrid" with chunk_top_k=20 for comprehensive search
    - This casts a wider net and combines multiple search strategies
    
    Args:
        query: The user's question or search query (e.g., "What are the main findings?")
        mode: Search mode - "naive" (default, recommended), "local" (context-aware), 
              "global" (document-level), or "hybrid" (comprehensive)
        chunk_top_k: Number of chunks to retrieve (default 10, use 20 for broader search)
    
    Returns:
        JSON string containing:
        - "chunks": Array of relevant text segments with references
        - "count": Total number of chunks found
